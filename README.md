## instaCanva âš¡: Seamlessly Bringing Canva to WhatsApp

instaCanva is an innovative WhatsApp bot that allows users to manage their Canva designs directly from WhatsApp, combining the ease of messaging with the powerful design capabilities of Canva. With instaCanva, you can create, upload, and export Canva designs without ever leaving WhatsApp, streamlining your design process and making it more accessible.

### Inspiration âœ¨:

The inspiration for instaCanva came from a personal milestoneâ€”reaching 200 designs on Canva. As a huge fan of Canva, I realized the growing need for a more accessible way to manage an increasing number of designs on the go. This need, combined with the rising prevalence of APIs and AI in modern applications, led me to team up with a fellow Canva enthusiast to create a solution that integrates Canvaâ€™s capabilities into WhatsApp. The idea is rooted in the belief that future applications will increasingly build on existing platforms to enhance productivity and efficiency, much like InstaCanva does.

### How We Built It
instaCanva was built using the following technologies:

- Python for the backend logic.
- Flask as the web framework to handle requests.
- Twilio & Sendgrid for WhatsApp & Email messaging integration.
- Canva Connect API for design management and authentication.
- Google Gemini AI for natural language processing to handle user commands.
The development process involved integrating these technologies to create a seamless experience for users, from authenticating their Canva accounts to managing their designs via WhatsApp.

### Challenges:

Building instaCanva presented several challenges:
- **Lack of Resources:** We found very few tutorials on developing applications that integrate with Canva, especially for developers. 
- **OAuth Implementation:** Implementing secure OAuth authentication with Canva proved to be a complex task.
- **File Handling:** Sending and receiving files from WhatsApp through Twilio to Canva involved intricate handling of media files, which was initially buggy.
- **Complex Codebase:** The early stages of development were plagued with numerous if-else statements, leading to a buggy and inefficient codebase.
  
Despite these challenges, we persevered, learning and adapting as we progressed. The experience highlighted the importance of solid code optimization, which is a priority for our future development.
